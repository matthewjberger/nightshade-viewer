#  Nightshade ðŸ¥€

`Nightshade` is a portable graphics engine written in rust, capable of rendering complex interactive visualizations of arbitrary data streams.

## Quickstart

### Desktop

```bash
cargo run -r
```

### Web


If you have [trunk](https://trunkrs.dev/) installed,
you can serve the app in a web browser:

```bash
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
cargo install --locked trunk
trunk serve --features web --open
```

> Firefox [does not have sufficient wgpu support](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41157383) and is considered incompatible.


### Justfile

If you have [just](https://github.com/casey/just) installed:

```bash
just run

just init-wasm
just run-web
```

> Run `just` with no arguments to list all commands

## Compact Release

A profile named `release-compact` in the `Cargo.toml` optimizes the build
for space, minimizing the final binary size.

If you have [upx](https://upx.github.io) installed, this can be done with:

```bash
# requires that `upx` is installed
just build-compact
```

The final executable is at `target/release-compact/nightshade` on unix and `target/release-compact/nightshade.exe` on windows.

> The binary size should be significantly smaller than the normal release build executable

## Python Bindings

If you have [maturin]() installed:

```bash
just build-python
```

Then you can install the generated python wheel with:

```bash
pip install python_api/target/wheels/nightshade-*.whl --force-reinstall
```

## Note for Windows Users

If `trunk` fails to install because of `openssl`,
you can use [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io/en/) to install it.

In `Powershell`, install `vcpkg`:

```bash
# Install vcpkg (optional if you use scoop or chocolatey instead)
iex (iwr -useb https://aka.ms/vcpkg-init.ps1)
```

Then install `openssl` with:

```bash
vcpkg integrate install
vcpkg.exe install openssl:x64-windows-static-md
```
